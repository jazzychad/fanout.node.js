fanout.js - a simple and robust fanout pubsub
messaging server for node.js by @jazzychad

MOTIVATION
==========
I needed a robust and scalable event-driven message fanout server for several
Comet-based webapps where some process in the backend could send various
messages of different types/channels to the clients (browsers) in the front-end.
fanout.js implements such a server using standard TCP sockets so that it can be
used in a wide variety of applications. Connection to web browsers is 
accomplished by using the TCPSocket abstraction in the Orbited.org project.

I have serveral webapps using this system. One has been running strong for
5 months without ever having to restart the node.js process.

OVERVIEW
========

The fanout pubsub system consists of three parts
 o The "fanout server" itself
 o One or more "Clients" (message subscribers)
 o One or more "Controllers" (message publishers)

The fanout server is run as a node.js process. Clients connect to the server on
the client port (default 8880). Controllers connect to the server on the
controller port (default 8890).

Clients can do 4 (four) things:
 o Subscribe to message channels
 o Unsubscribe from message channels
 o Receive messages on subscribed message channels
 o Ping the fanout server for the current unix millitime

Controllers can do 1 (one) thing:
 o Send (publish) messages on message channels

Upon connection, each Client is automatically subscribed to the "all" message
channel, so that if a Controller publishes a message to the "all" message
channel, each Client will receive it. This is useful for sending system-wide
messages to all connected clients. Clients can choose to unsubscribe from the
"all" channel if they so choose. Also upon connection, each client will receive
a message on the "debug" message channel notifying them that they have connected
to the server.

CLIENT PROTOCOL
===============

  Subscribing
  -----------
  Clients subscribe to a message channel by sending a message of the format:

  subscribe<space><channel_name>

  Message channel names are one word tokens which may not include spaces.

  Example:

  subscribe foo

  will subscribe to the client to the message channel called foo

  If a client subscribes to a channel for which it is already subscribed,
  the duplicate subscribe request is effectively ignored.

  Unsubscribing
  -------------
  Client unsubscribe to a message channel by sending a message of the format:

  unsubscribe<space><channel_name>

  The message channel name must match exactly the name of the channel to which
  the client is already subscribed (it is case-sensitive). 

  Example:

  unsubscribe foo

  will unsubscribe the client from the message channel called foo

  Sending an unsubscribe request for a message channel to which the client is 
  not already subscribed is effectively treated as a no-op.


  Ping the Server
  ---------------
  Clients may ping the fanout server by sending a special message:

  time

  The server will respond with the current time as milliseconds elapsed since
  the Unix Epoch.


  Receiving Messages
  ------------------
  Once a Client subscribes to one or more message channels, when a Controller
  publishes messages to those specific channels, the Client will automatically
  receive the message in the format:

  <channel_name>!<message><newline_character>

  Example:

  A controller sends the message "hello, world" to the message channel "foo".
  The clients subscribed to "foo" will receive the following message:

  foo!hello, world

  (including a final newline character to signify the end of the message).


CONTROLLER PROTOCOL
===================

  Publishing a Message
  --------------------

  Controllers publish messages to message channels in the following format:

  <channel_name><space><message><newline>

  Example:

  A Controller wants to send the message "hello, world" to the message
  channel called "foo".

  foo hello, world

  (including a final newline character to signify the end of the message).

  The first word of Controller messages is always taken to mean the destination
  message channel. Everything after the first space is taken as the message
  to publish on that channel.

  Message channels are "soft" in that they do not need to be declared or
  otherwise created prior to publishing messages on them. If a Controller 
  publishes a message to a channel with no subscribers, the message is 
  effectively dropped.


USAGE
=====

Assuming you have installed node.js on your machine/server, all you need 
is this:

  node fanout.js


EXAMPLE
=======

Open 4 (four) terminal windows.

In Terminal 1, run fanout.js

  node fanout.js

In Terminal 2, connect as a Controller

  netcat localhost 8890

In Terminal 3, connect as a Client

  netcat localhost 8880

In Terminal 4, connect as another Client

  netcat localhost 8880

In terminal 2, type

  all hello everybody

and hit return. You should see "all!hello everybody" appear in both 
Terminal 3 and 4.

In Terminal 3, type

  subscribe aaa

and hit return. In Terminal 4, type

  subscribe bbb

and hit return.

In Terminal 2, type

  aaa only one client should see this

and hit return. You should see the message received by Terminal 3.

In Terminal 2, type

  bbb only the other client should see this

and hit return. You should see the message received by Terminal 4.

In Terminal 2, type

  ccc nobody should see this message

and hit return. Since there are no subscribers to the "ccc" channel, it will
not be received by any clients.

In Terminal 3, type

  unsubscribe aaa

and hit return. In Terminal 2, type

  aaa will anyone see this now? nope...

and hit return. Since Terminal 3 just unsubscribed from "aaa" it should not
receive the message.

Continue experimenting with different subscribe/unsubscribe commands from the
Clients and publishing different messages on different channels with the
Controller. You should figure out the basic use rather quickly.
